# Meme Scraper

## About

Meme Scraper is a cli (Command Line Interface) application that saves the first 10 images of the website:

https://memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app/

The images are saved into a folder called "memes" within the directory of the new project.

The images will be saved as 01.jpg, 02.jpg, 03.jpg, etc.

If the program is run multiple times, the existing images will be overwritten.

## Additional function:

The application will create a custom meme based on a user input. The user input order is

1. top text
2. bottom text
3. meme name
